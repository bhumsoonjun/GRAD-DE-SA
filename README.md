### code

This is where each algorithm is implemented and tested. The test and implementation of each algorithm are in the following respective files in code directory.

- DE-SA: de_sa_grad.ipynb
- DE: de.ipynb
- GE: ge.ipynb
- DA: da.ipynb
- ABC: abc.ipynb
- PSO: pso.ipynb

### results

The output of each algorithm is in the results directory.

### literatures

This is the directory that stores some of the literature used in the paper.

### presentation

Directory for slide

### term paper.pdf
